What was, what was that?</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Well, he, he was, he had, uh, what, what he did was he sold boulders, uh, he would bring in a car load of lumber and then he would tally it out and sell it off to the, uh, to the builders. And they uh, in this particular case they, they weren't able to pay him, and that was probably during the uh, depression, and he took the uh, the house in trade, and some of the also uh [11:00] sometimes they just, that was part of the arrangement that they would supply the material and then they, and then when they would build a track of houses, and would get a house and uh, so that that would compensate them.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: [indistinguishable] says the family gave them  five thousand dollars for a wedding present, now was this in a house that hecould sell or was this a cash present</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: That was probably a cash—c—cash present that I’m sure my mother used to furnish the, uh, the house</p><p>INTERVIEWER [overlapping]: mhmm</p><p>JOEL MILLNER [continuing]:you know, because she had very expensive taste, and, uh, she didn’t, uh, [12:00] she wouldn’t settle for anything less than the best you know, uh.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:[indistinguishable]  said they loaded, loaded a truck with lumber and then he went out and sold it is that, is that what he did?</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Well, usually they would, uh, not necessarily load a truck, but they would load off a box car to somebody else’s truck, and then what—what wasn’t sold then I guess, then he had to find uh, storage space, and, then  I guess that’s when he, he, uh, must’ve bought a, uh, um, a, um, a, uh, I guess a guy had a uh, up on Ingham avenue had a uh, a uhm, mill shop and he probably bought that, uh, I think the [13:00] family name was uh, uh, Halpert.

What—what was that story he was tellin? He ordered a car load of nails, and, uh, in kegs and then went out and peddled them all? </p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Well, that waswhat he did, you know, [19:00] uh, uh, you know he would buy and, and—</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Well what got him into the wholesale business?

W—Wha—</p><p>JOEL MILLNER [interrupting]: Well they manufactured school and church furniture, uh, and uh, and then I guess uh, during the depression uh, you know, that—it was a very successful, uh, uh, business, but the uh, then I think the, during the depression they wanted to work for the uh, for the people, uh, in the different, uh, states. So they, there really was, th—uh, that the school furniture would be manufactured within the state, [22:00] not in—in, uh, in Trenton.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Ho—How old is this building? Because wooden beams that you have here</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: This, uh, this has to be a hundred years old I would think, or uh close to it.</p><p>SPEAKER 3: [indistinguishable] Gonna get a quick bite</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Well why don’t you wait until I'm done with uh, this oral, because uh, you know he’s, uh, not gonna be, uh—</p><p>INTERVIEWER: No, it won’t be that much longer, just a little bit</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: uh, and we uh, uh, in fact, uh, he, they had a s—sale here, when they sold out, and you can’t believe the desk that he bought.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: In all the time, are there any of those things still left in here, the old window sashes, [indistinguishable], old doors, old desks?

That’s why I tell people I‘ve been working around here 55 years uh</p><p>INTERVIEWER: That’s when we all started, about that age. </p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Yeah [laughing], you know, uh, uh and, in those days it was uh, [25:00] hard work you know, they didn’t have the mechanical equipment that they have today, you know, for unloading, and we used to get up, uh, you know, come to work 6 o’clock in the morning and sometimes work ‘til 6:30,7:00 at night, you know, was, uh, stuff had to be, uh, loaded and shipped and what not, uh</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Do you remember what the first trucks were that were in here that you were able to—that you were permitted to drive?</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Oh, well that was a, uh, well I picked up the, uh, I was a, uh, driving trucks before I was permitted to drive, you know uh, I remember I guess it must’ve been, uh, must’ve been 1941 or so, you know, uh, I went over and took one of the trucks out of the garage on a Sunday, and uh and drove it up to uh, [26:00] Slocums Bowling Alley and uh, on Pennington Road, and we were bowling and didn’t have a license, and uh, and uh on the way back we ran out of gas, and because there were no gas stations open because they had gas rationing, and what not, and uh, so uh, well I was with two other fellas, and I said well [indistinguishable]do is go back and get the other truck and tow it back to uh, to the uh, yard. So, uh, whichever we did, we had to take the bus back to Prospect Street from Pennington Road, I brought the other truck up and we started to tow it back and we you know, came down Parkside Avenue, made the turn going up Oakland Street, and uh, somewhere [27:00] along the line something happened to one of the uh, to the uh, break on the truck that was being towed, and we, uh, we got to corner of Prospect and, uh, Oakland and Prospect and I, ya know, stopped the uh, uh, stopped the truck to make the turn and all of a sudden “BOOM”, the car comes in and crashes the whole uh, headlight and fender. So, uh, I said, “oh this isn’t very goo—not very good, what are we gonna do about this?” And I said, “well we still have to take the truck down Prospect Street and take it around the back of the, uh, building where it gets parked”, and I said “now, look, when we, when we, when I signal that I'm stopping, you know, turn the, uh, truck away, so that we, the truck wont hit the back of the, um, the tow truck won’t hit the back of the truck we got”, [28:00] and okay, I wave, and he’s supposed to pull away and all of a sudden “BOOM” got the other fender, and uh, headlight, and, but I don’t know, I think the charge to have it repaired was like $300 dollars but I paid it back, uhhm, but uh, that was, uh, you know, that’s when I was driving, you know, um you know, must’ve been—</p><p>INTERVIEWER [interrupting]: Did they ever have, did Millner Lumber every have a horse drawn?</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: I think originally yeah, he,he did, you know, yeah.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Are there any pictures of—of that ar—ar—around?</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: No, no, and I think we used to, originally, um, o—one of the trucks, you know, yo—you had to crank it to uhh, uh, to start it.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: ‘cause we came across some of shines trucks with a horse wagon, and then  som—another truck.</p><p>JOEL MILLNER: Yea, yeah, no [29:00] I don’t believe we have any pictures of that, but uh</p><p>INTERVIEWER: So, when did your dad actually retire from here and went to Florida, and didn’t, and didn’t—</p><p>JOEL MILLNER [interrupting]: Well, I don't think he ever really retired, you know, uh, uh, I, you know, when we came into the business, and—and probably wrongly so, in 1952, you know, we were both here, when I was at—finished college, [indistinguishable] was here uh, you know, while I was in, in college, and he decided he didn’t want to go to college, er uh, and, uh, my father pretty much backed off, you know, from uh, being an active participant, he wanted to be a participant, but uh he, he, he, he didn't want the, the daily uhh, problems, that uh, ya know, the servicing the customers uh, that uh, that uh, were required, ya know. [30:00] I mean, he wanted to make the decisions, but he wasn't around, you know, to uh, to uh, to make the decisions, and uh, we found it necessary to make the decisions, and then have him, you know, uh, uh, say well you shouldn't have done this or you shouldn't of done that.
