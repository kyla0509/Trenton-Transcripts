Today is January 19th, 1995. I am at, uh, Greenwood House, speaking with Samuel Rudner. </p><p>SAMUEL RUDNER: My mother came from a town in Austria, but I don't know how to spell it. Zaklochin [spelling?]. Have you ever heard of that?</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yes, I've heard of it, but I don't know how to spell it either.</p><p>RUDNER: Well, it was in Poland it could be. I don't know. My father came from Yusolv [spelling?], which is definitely Polish. They were married in New York [or Newark?], and I think they had a child in New York, but things were tough, and my mother had relatives in the Newark area, who were established. They had come over, so they helped my parents come to this country. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: Sam, do you have any idea of the year? [RUDNER: Well, I—] Of the dates, when they came over, any idea?</p><p>RUDNER: It was the latter part of the last century. I think. And, in fact, I think they had one child, but that child died and is buried I don't know where, some place in Newark. Uh, they were married in Newark.  </p><p>INTERVIEWER: How long did they stay in Newark? </p><p>RUDNER: Where?</p><p>INTERVIEWER: In Newark with your mother's relatives.</p><p>RUDNER: Yeah, well, see, my father had family who own a liquor business. I don't know whether you ever heard of the Steiner family.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yes.</p><p>RUDNER: I think they were, uh, wholesalers of the liquor. And they put up quite a few members of that family in the liquor business. Uh, my father, for example, in Trenton. Uh, other people in Northern New Jersey, some in Wilmington. It was the Steiner family. Does that name mean anything?</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I heard of it. </p><p>RUDNER: Used to be the Zucker, Steiner & Co. Uh, and then my parents arrived, I think, in New Jersey the early part of the century. And they were married in New York, and I think they had tough going. My—They had a daughter, Bertha, uh, and they had two sons, Louis and Otto. They were all born in this country. Uh, my father initially lived in Northern New Jersey. And he—my mother's family was part of the Zucker-Steiner establishment. They were wholesale liquor dealers. [INTERVIEWER: Mhm.] And they were important members of the family in the liquor business, which they did with my father. My father settled, I understand, in the Trenton area, but the early part of this century. And, uh, he had children: two sons and a daughter. Uh, the daughter—Diabetes ran in my mother's family, and it was a shame. My mother's first child, a girl, died in 1911, I think, of diabetes. At that time, they didn't have insulin. Uh, my sister and I, twins, were born in 1903 in Trenton, and they had had two children besides this daughter in Newark. Louis, he later was a lawyer in Trenton, and Otto. They were all born in Newark. And my mother's family, the Steiner family, the Zucker-Steiner family, were in the wholesale liquor business, and they would put members in the business. [INTERVIEWER: Mhm.] So that's how they did it.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And when your father got, your parents got to Trenton, what—Did he go into business here?</p><p>RUDNER: Well, they put him in the liquor business. [INTERVIEWER: I see.] And then the Prohibition came, they were out. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: When he first moved— [RUDNER: Pardon?] When he first moved to Trenton, where did you live?</p><p>RUDNER: Uh, I'll, I'll have to guess. I don't know. I think he lived in the Chambersburg area. [INTERVIEWER: And in, during your childhood—] I was born on South Clinton Avenue. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: South Clinton?</p><p>RUDNER: And my—I had a twin sister, Rose. We were born, I'm quite sure, in the Chambersburg area. They had two sons and a daughter. They were born, I think, in the Newark area. One daughter, Bertha, was the oldest, and evidently, diabetes ran in my mother's family, and she died around 1911, this daughter, of diabetes. And that shocked my old father. By 1911, I was 8 years old. I remember her but not too much. Then I had two brothers and a third sister. Louis was one of my brothers. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: He was an attorney, wasn't he? </p><p>RUDNER: He was an attorney, yes. He graduated from Harvard. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: Mhm. And Otto?</p><p>RUDNER: Pardon me?</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And your brother, Otto, was a [RUDNER: Went to Harvard.] stockbroker, if I remember right. </p><p>RUDNER: That's right. Louis, uh, did very well, and he was made a member of the Katzenbach family. Katzenbach later became Katzenbach, Gildea & Rudner. And Mr. Katzenbach invited my brother. He was Jewish, and, of course, they weren't. But he went there, and I've forgotten when. And evidently he became a partner. My brother, Otto, was a stockbroker, and, uh, I went to Harvard Law School. And I graduated in 1929 and through Frankfurter, who was one of my professors, I got a job. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: That was Felix Frankfurter?</p><p>RUDNER: That was Felix Frankfurter, was one of my professors. You're not gonna publish this, are you? And he got me a job in New York City. Felix Frankfurter. When it was very difficult for a Jewish fella. As a matter of fact, if you went to New York City to look for a job, they'd ask you your religion. And, uh, now they can't do that. I had a very good record at the Harvard Law School, and I got a letter from a New York firm, stating that they might have an opening, so I went to—They asked me to go to New York for a meeting with one of their partners, and I did, at my expense. And it was strange. We had a good meeting. And at the end, the partner said, "By the way, you Presbyterian?" Well, when he asked me that, I knew. I said, uh, no, I was the Jewish, uh, faith. He said it didn't make any difference, but I had a [inaudible]. He said he'd let me know one way or another, and I never heard from him. Uh—</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Did you ever run across him again?</p><p>RUDNER: Huh?</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Did you ever run across this man again? </p><p>RUDNER: I ran across him once. It was a funny thing. When I went to New York for that visit, I went to—I got off the train at Grand Central Station in New York and went into the barbershop for a shave and haircut. Who's sitting in the next chair but Professor Felix Frankfurt, one of my professors. So he said, "When you were here, see Carl Austrian and tell him I sent you." Uh, and then see me when you get back to Cambridge. So I saw Carl Austrian, and that's where I ultimately went. But when I saw the other fella, who invited me, he asked me if I was Presbyterian. So I saw Frankfurter when I got back from Cambridge, and I told him that, and he said, "You'll never hear from him." I never did. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: Oh, this is the man who inquired whether you were Presbyterian. </p><p>RUDNER: That, that's the only thing that hurt me. Uh, Frankfurter said to me—I'll quote him—"You won't hear from the son of a bitch." [laughter] I said, "You mean to tell me this man invites me, and I go there at my expense, and he tells me he'll let me know, and he doesn't do it?" He said, "That's exactly it." And I never heard from him. Frankfurter would, in class or before, he would say, "Have you heard from this guy?" and I said, "No," and he said, "I told you you wouldn't hear from the son of a bitch." [laughter] But where Frankfurter told me to go that's where I got a job, and I became a partner in that firm after five years. And I was a partner in—I had a brother, Louis, who was a lawyer in Trenton, and I think it was '44 or '45, I've forgotten now. He was taking my twin sister to a matinee in New York, and then the three of us were gonna have dinner for my sister's birthday and mine. Well, first thing in the morning, he got a heart attack and died. So instead of going to dinner that night, I got a letter from Otto saying to come home Lou is sick on Saturday morning. He had already died. And that was a big shock to me. Uh, but Lou was a wonderful person. And so was Otto, but they were different. Uh, well, I was then and we had been in New York for 15 years, and I was a partner in a firm in New York. And while in Trenton, I had a meeting with Lou's partners at the Katzenbach office—Harris Farley, George Gildea, and Bill Lee—about Lou's affairs and how he was gonna wind up. So George Gildea said to me, "Have you ever thought of coming back to Trenton?" I said, "No I haven't." I said, "That gives me another problem." They said, "We would like you to come back." And so I told them I would think—Well, then I did come back. And they were very nice to me. And so I stayed there. I stayed there. But the firm in New York wanted was—didn't want me to leave. But I told them I, I was going back. I went back. I'm not—I don't regret it. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: No, you spent a lot of good years as an important member of a community. </p><p>RUDNER: Well, I became a—See, I had to take the New Jersey bar exam. [laughter] And I had been practicing 15 years. I never had to take an exam in 15 years. Well, I passed it. And I came back. And they were very good to me. I was the only Jewish lawyer there. And, uh, for example, after a while, they increased my percentage, and they—I never had to ask them. They always did it voluntarily. And they were very good people. And, uh, so that firm is now a big firm. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: I've lost track of the name. I don't know who's on first. </p><p>RUDNER: Well, it's a big firm. </p><p>INTERVIEWER: Dick and Dick. [RUDNER: What?] Dick Cohen and Dick Walkow are still part of it, aren't they?</p><p>RUDNER: When I was there, we had George Gildea, Dick Lee, Bill Lee, Harris Farley, and I were—I became a partner. But they were very good. And, uh, very nice and very decent. So I had admired—</p><p>INTERVIEWER: That was good. </p>        <!-- button that links to the comment page-->        <div class="right3">            <li class="right3"><a class="cbutton" href="{{ url_for('comment') }}">Make a Comment</a></li>        </div>    </main></body></html>
