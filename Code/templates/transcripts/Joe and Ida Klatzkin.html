Names of speakers 1,2, and 3 are unknown</p><p>[00:00]</p><p>Speaker 1: [inaudible] Okay, could you tell me about what happened to the best of your recollection.</p><p>Speaker 2: There’s uh, I was coming up uh, I was in the uh—</p><p>Speaker 1: Test 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Okay, this is Wednesday, 10/8, 1988. Testing; 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. And with us today, our honored guest, is Ida May Klatzkin. Thanks for being with us this morning.</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: [laughing] Do I have a choice? [laughing continues]</p><p>Speaker 1: well, not really. First of all, I just want to say that, you’re my grandmother, and it’s always been a pleasure having you as m—</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: On your Mother’s side?</p><p>Speaker 1: On my Mother’s side.</p><p> Ida May Klatzkin: On your Mother’s side, yeah.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay. I wanna go back here a little bit. First of all, because uh, when Amy grows up she’s gonna ask a lot of questions. And uh, number one I guess is, when you came to America. You were- you were not a Klatzkin then. What was your full maiden name? </p><p>[1:00] Ida May Klatzkin: When I came to America [laughing]? I was born in Philadelphia, and my maiden name was Ida May Smith. And I met Joseph Klatzkin while I was going to grade school. And his father was my violin teacher, when I was in grade school. And so, I got to know his father very well before I knew him ‘cus his [inaudible] had been similar to the school in New York City. A boarding school, which was, at that time, was very unusual. No one ever went away, you know? Children all, all stayed in their own cities. So, I didn’t get to know him very well, as we were growing up, but—</p><p>Speaker 1: We’ll get back to that in a minute, about— a little bit more about when you met uh, JoJo. You uh, you were born in Philadelphia, but your family came over from Lithuania, right?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: mm—hm</p><p>Speaker 1: Tell me a little about your mother and father.</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Well, my mother and father were sweethearts uh, when they were children [2:00], and when my father left Lithuania, he was about nineteen years old, he went to Philadelphia where most of his family had already gone. And, my mother didn’t leave until years afterwards, uh trying to find my father in, in the United States.</p><p>Speaker 1: Did the—, did they know each other prior t-to leaving?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Oh, well they grew up together, no, no, he was older then she. They—, they knew each other’s families, and they lived in the same city, and they were very close families. And, when she— when she left Lithuania, my father had already had been in the United States for about five years, and she went to find him.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, your- your mother’s maiden name was, what?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Arronson</p><p>Speaker 1: Her whole— her whole name was?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Devera Esther Arronson. And uh—</p><p>Speaker 1: Let me see if I can find it.</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: He was Lewis Smith. Uh—huh</p><p>Speaker 1: And what, what city in Lithuania were they from?</p><p>[3:00] Ida May Klatzkin: From, the place in, near Riga, Riga is the large city, and I’m trying to think of the small town— [inaudible] I haven’t thought about it in so many years, and I can’t remember it right off hand.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, but they— they grew up together there, in Lithuania?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: They, their families were friends, and uh, though my father was older than my mother, maybe about five years uh, they knew each other very well. And my father had left for the United States before my mother came over, but actually, they were— they were sweethearts! And she actually left her whole family, and went to the United States all by herself, to find him, and found him engaged to another woman. </p><p>Speaker 1: What happened then?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: [laughing] He was sued for—What do you sue people when they break their engagement?</p><p>Speaker 1: Breach of promise?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Breach of promise [laughing]. </p><p>Speaker 1: Really?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Very funny, it’s very— we always laughed about [4:00] that because of— you never thought a breach of promise way back in those days would have happened, but it was. He  ch— he was sued for breach of promise, but he married my mother, and um, they were very happily married.</p><p>Speaker 1: Did your mother’s family stay behind in Lithuania?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: My mother's family, not any of them came over, except a brother came over, oh many years later, just one brother, but all the others were taken care of by the Germans when they came in to Lithuania, they were all killed. </p><p>Speaker 1: Did you ever have a chance to meet your grandparents on your mother’s side?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: No, just by mail. We only wrote to them. We never, we never saw them, and just this one brother that came to the United States, and lived with, with us.</p><p>Speaker 1: How many, how many brothers and sisters did she have other than this one brother?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Well, the sh— sh— I really can’t remember how may she had because uh, you know, they lived so far away, and we were growing up we didn't, ya know, we kept writing but we wrote to the family so [5:00] we really didn’t know. But there were brothers and sisters, and no one came over to the United States except this one brother, [inaudible] came to live with us so we got to know him very well.</p><p>Speaker 1: Now your, I take it your mother was alive up until the time of this— the, the Germans moved in back in World War II?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Yes, uh—huh. </p><p>Speaker 1: [inaudible]</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Sh— She had her, her two older sisters uh escaped and went to Russia, and we had very little communication from them because it was the idea was that, you know, they had no means of writing to us and they didn't know Russian, and they didn’t— well we— I don't know but we used to get the strangest letters and we’d have to have them translated by different people and um we sorta lost touch with them after my mother passed away. She passed away early.</p><p>Speaker 1: Do you remember when that was? </p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: My mother died oh, I have a blank. [6:00] It was a long time ago.  </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, your uh, your, your father’s family all came over with him, pretty much?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Yeah, they all, they all were in the United States, they were all, they were all here.</p><p>[child’s voice inaudible in background]</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: uh, I don’t—</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay. uh, your father, Lewis Smith, what did he do for a living?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Well, he, he, my mother came here he’d been here about five years, and he was engaged to marry another woman which he— I don't know if I told you this [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: Breach of Promise?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Breach of promise. It was very sad. He, uh, made trunks. You know what a trunk is? </p><p>Speaker 1: packing trunks?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: You know, big trunk, that, that, that you pack your clothes in</p><p>Speaker 1: [inaudible]</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: and uh, that was his work that he did, and uh, my mother she came from a wealthy family, and she came over in grand style [7:00]. She came with all the loveliest things that she brought over, and uh, her mode of living came down considerably when she came over here because, ya know, things were not so wonderful was they all thought it was gonna be you know-  [phone ringing] </p><p>Speaker 1: So, your mother’s intention, upon leaving Lithuania to come here, was to marry your father?</p><p>Ida: Yes, because they had been sweethearts when they were children. They always thought they would be married when, when they got together , but then he came over here and he was here, and in fact, he was engaged to be married to another woman when she came over and he was sued for breach of promise. I don't know if I said this to you or not.</p><p>Speaker 1: What did uh, your mother’s parents do in Lithuania, do you remember?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: mmh, no, I don’t, I don’t have any, I have no recollection of what they, what they did.</p><p>Speaker 1: Alright, how ‘bout your, how ‘bout your father’s family? [inaudible]</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: mmmh, no. </p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay. What uh—</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: [inaudible] quite young [inaudible]</p><p>[8:00] Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about uh his, his family’s decision to come to America?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: No, ‘cause this was the best place to come to and his whole family came, all his brothers and sisters were over here. My mother came over all alone because she just came over to be with my father, ya know, because they had been sweethearts over there, and she had a lot of nerve because he was engaged to marry somebody else when she came over here [laughing].</p><p>Speaker 1: What uh, what is your earliest memory? You say you were born in Philadelphia, but uh, you were ahh—, I guess you stay— you lived there for a while.</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: No, we didn’t live there too long. We lived in Philadelphia, several years, and um, when I started school; kindergarten, I lived in Maniuk, and I— I was there through second grade and then we moved back to Philadelphia, again. By the time I got to third grade, we had moved to Trenton, and we stayed here permanently. </p><p>Speaker 1: Now, uh, you said, you, you remember where you went to school here?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Yes! I went to Parker school [9:00], and it was a lovely school. Those teachers were wonderful. They were my best friends. In fact, I was the only child that ever got to boast to the teachers that I was always invited to their homes, for holidays and uh all. I, I had a wonderful time, with my teachers</p><p>Speaker 1: Now, wa— was that the same school all the way through high school?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: No, this was grade school up until sixth grade, and then I went to another school up until eighth grade, and after that, it was high school. </p><p>Speaker 1: Which one was that?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: S- The  Central High. And then um, I went, I decided that I, well, at, at that time I needed to go to work because things were kinda rough on the family. So, I decided that I would finish my education at night and go to high school at night, and I went to Robert college in the day time. I could go to school, and get, you know, an education there, complete, Uhm, education’s gonna likely get a good job, and I did. I got a wonderful job. [10:00] I still went to school [laughing].</p><p> </p><p>Speaker 1: What was your first job?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: It was the only job I ever had. I had been, uh I worked as a secretary for a sales manager of a large factory, and he was just so wonderful, just wonderful. He was writing a book and I helped on the book, and I used to earn about twenty dollars a week extra. At that time, that was a lot more money  . I was very rich [laughing], and uh, so we, we, we  worked on this for, for a couple of years before it was published.</p><p>Speaker 1: Now, at that time had you met uh, Joseph P. Klatzkin? You said you sort of uh, had some contact with him.</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: His father was my violin teacher, and I had been taking violin lessons when I was in grade school, seventh grade. And um, they lived close by, his family, and his mother used to take him to our store. Uh, th— uh, I used to see him that way, but there was nothing, you know—</p><p>Speaker 1: Nothing special</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Nothing special, [laughing] except that I knew him, [11:00] you know. I never—, but then when he went to high school his parents sent him to a theological seminary in New York City. And then I used to get packages. [inaudible] never put his real name down, always his initials [inaudible]. I used to get lots of packages all through the years that he was there. [laughing] so—</p><p>Speaker 1: Wha, What sort of packages?</p><p>Ida: Oh, stationary and playing cards with my initials on your card, but it, it was always something that he would, would send.</p><p>Speaker 1: So, you established a relationship by mail, pretty much. </p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Well, it wasn’t by mail. I used to get packages [laughing], and then when he came home I would see him, but we, we were well, I know he, he was sweet on me all the time, it took me a long time to realize what was happening but, but we were, we were friends very early in our, our lives. </p><p>Speaker 1: What, What uh made you wanna take the violin, or was that your parent’s decision?</p><p>[12:00] Ida May Klatzkin: Well, uh I, I was naturally musical. I played the piano without taking lessons, I was able to read music and everything, and we didn’t have a piano, but I used to play it on other people’s pianos [laughing], and uh, my uh my mother decided well we couldn't afford to buy a piano so she thought the best thing was to get a violin and that’s how I met jojo’s father, he was my violin teacher, and uh—</p><p>Speaker 1: Did you go over to his house to take lessons?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: uh, uh I think he came to our house to take lessons or to teach lessons, and I really didn't meet jojo that way, but I knew him, his mother used to bring him over to our store, when she went shopping. So, we, we grew up knowing each other very quite well.</p><p>Speaker 1: Now, you had a lot of brothers and sisters, didn’t you?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: I had one brother and two sisters. </p><p>[Inaudible from (12: 50) to (19:30)]</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: and they would get into each other’s hair all the time, but she always made sure that the— nothing happened that was serious, and so we got along fine [laughing].</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay. So, as they started growing uh, what was JoJo doing, as far as his job? Did he ultimately set up his own company?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: uh—huh. He wen—, he went into business for himself, but he worked awfully hard because he had to have a job. First, with the CPA so he could get his three [20:00] years of experience with the CPA before he could take his, his exams and become certified himself, and uh that was never very much money so he had to work nights at uh, jobs that he would have. He worked awfully hard, and uhm, whatever he has, he had it coming to him because uh [laughing] he worked, he worked, he really worked day and night.</p><p>Speaker 1: Now, all during this time, were you staying home with the kids?</p><p>Ida May Klatzkin: Oh, yes. We h—, we had built a house! We bought a house. I had a, a good job and I just thought I was gonna, gonna  have this job forever, but then when I became pregnant, ya know, I couldn't keep on having the job, and once the baby [inaudible] up until about 7 ½ months I worked, ya know, kept up my work, but uh, I had a wonderful job.</p><p>Speaker 1: Now, I take it  ya then, after you quit, and had, and kids were born. Did you, you stayed, you didn’t work again for a while, did ya? </p><p>[21:00] Ida May Klatzkin: No, well I did uh, Joseph went into business for himself, and I did all his work at home.</p><p>Speaker 1: Right. </p><p>Speaker 1: Test 1,2,3,4,5. Everything’s working. Okay, I suppose the best place to start is uh, where you were born?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I was born in Lithuania, in the city of Posvol.</p><p>Speaker 1: How do you spell that?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Posvol; P—O—S—V—O—L, in Lithuania.</p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay, and the year? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: And the year? 1905. </p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay, now you didn’t, you didn’t stay there for too long. Tell me, tell me a little bit about your early memories back in Posvol. </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: The only memories in Posvol was that my granpop, my grandfather, ehh used to always like to chase me. And uh, and he used to call me “spoont”. “Spoont” means a kind of apparel, I was, I was as wide as I was tall, you know what I mean? I was a heavy little kid, and he scared the hecks out of me when he used to always [22:00] chase me, and that’s the only thing I can remember from that town. I left there when I was about six years old. </p><p>Speaker 1: Why did he chase you? Do you remember that? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well they, they had a lot of fun, that to him was a lot of fun. My grandfather chasing his grandson, you know what I mean? That’s, that’s [inaudible] as fun.</p><p>Speaker 1: Did he chase you inside or outside?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: ahh, mostly outside. Uh, just to have fun, ya know? That was his fun, and me, was uh, a tragedy. [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: Was this uh your grandfather on your mother’s side or your father’s side?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: uh, my father’s side.</p><p>Speaker 1: What was his name?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I don't know his name, but he was also a musician. They were all a musician; my father was a musician, he was a musician. They were all musicians, and that’s why they call “Klatzkin” as they uh—It comes from the name “klasma”, “klasma” means a musician. </p><p>Speaker 1: In what? Hebrew?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: eh, No, in Jewish. </p><p>Speaker 1: Oh, okay, alright, and ‘kay, now your father was a musician [23:00]. I know be— he uh, ‘cause he taught bubby violin at one point. His name was?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Samuel “Shmo” Morkai, Samuel M. </p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay, Klatzkin?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: yeah, ‘course. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, did your family, had your family lived in that city uh, for a long time? ‘Cause they were from that part [inaudible]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, that’s, that’s where they were raised, [inaudible] my father, my grandfather, they were raised, and we were all— all the 13 children were from there.</p><p>Speaker 1: And where did you fall in that line of 13?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I was number 12 of 13.</p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay. Do you remember the names of all the others?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, sure. Uh, the oldest one was uh Ben— Benjamin and next came Mars; Mars was a musician, Benjamin was a jeweler. Then came uh Jenny and Hanna, two girls. Two, two, and two, and after that came Leon and Harry, and then came uh, uh, [24:00] then came uh, Ruth, and uh [inaudible] can't think of the other name, Ruth and, they're all dead. Ruth and uh—</p><p>Speaker 1: ‘nother girl?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: ‘nother girl, yeah, it was two and two. And after that came uh Eddy—Eddy, and uh and myself, and then my sister Tilly was 13. </p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay, so—</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: One of them died, his name was Joe—Joseph also, and I was named after him, see ‘cause I never knew,  I was born when he died, and therefore they named me Joseph, but actually Joseph was his name, but they called me “Pinchas” because they didn't wanna think of the person that just died. So, my name is really “Pinchas” Joseph.</p><p>Speaker 1: How do you spell that? “Pinchas”? “Pinchas”?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: “Pinchas” was uh, well we, in, in English they, they translated it as Philip.</p><p>Speaker 1: oh, okay</p><p>[25:00] Joseph Klatzkin: [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: So, nobody ever called you that?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, Joseph Philip [inaudible], my name uh—</p><p>Speaker 1: We’re back, this is June 8th, 1988, same day. Okay, you said you remembered the other two sisters?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: uh, the two sisters was Minnie and Ruth.</p><p>Speaker: ‘kay, they're the ones closest to you?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, Minnie and Ruth, and after that came Eddie and I. Eddie and Joe, and then 13 was Tilly. </p><p> </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, you say you were, you remember being chased around by your grandfather, but uh, do you remember the layout of the town, or anything?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, I don’t remember anything, but that wasn’t in my mind because he always chased me, and I was horrified, [laughing] and he was having a good time chasin’ me so—</p><p>Speaker 1: Did he ever catch you? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: He didn't cheat me. He, evidently, never caught me because this is what had happened, he just kept runnin’ around—</p><p>Speaker 1: Why did your family decide to come to America?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: The decision to come to America was because they were taking all the boys, ya know, we had a lot of boys [26:00]. Uh, [inaudible] how many boys about? Two, four, six boys to take ‘em in the Russian army, and of course they were all very religious, and you don't eat Kosher stuff when you’re in the army. So, they all went away to America to escape really being in the army. So, after about uh four or five of us went to, went to America, then family felt bad that half was here and half was in Europe, you know what I mean? So, we all deci—, the balance of us came, came over at one time. </p><p>Speaker 1: okay, but the boys went first?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: The boys went first. The elderly boys went first, and the reason was that they— that’s how they got out of the army.</p><p>Speaker 1: Well now, was—Lithuania wasn’t actually part of the Soviet—er, Russia back then, was it?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, it was part of Russia because that's why they was talking about the being in the Russian army, see? </p><p>Speaker 1: Yeah, Okay, okay. I knew that all, I’ll probably have to check my history. Okay [27:00] uhm, Okay so,  as a—I guess it was more of a what? A protest against—kind of like a conscientious objection.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: That's right. If they didn’t have to go in the army, we’d of never come to the United States, really didn't, and when 4 or 5 of the boys went in the arm—went to the United States. Then the family was so, the father, the mother, and the family were so lonesome that we came back to be part with all of us together. </p><p>Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was, that you left?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, uh let's see, I was born 1905, and I was about six years old; about 1911. We went on a, on a, what they call a uh, boat uh, we were in the bottom of the boat. What the hell they call it? Do you know what I mean? </p><p>Speaker 1: Hull?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: It’s the cheapest part of the boat. And the only thing I remembered of the boat is when one of the, one of the sailors used to have to put light, light the lights at night, see, and he—when he was climbing up the, the uh, the [28:00] s- the uh lighting sti—pole, a big wave came around and threw him over and he was drowned. It was a lot of excitement so, because of that excitement,  this is the only thing I remember of the boat. </p><p>Speaker 1: You didn't see it happen? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, but I heard all the, you know, all the, all the excitement, and they couldn’t save him. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, but that’s pretty much all you remembered about—</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: That’s all I remember about the boat [laughing]. See, I remember excitement, you remember excitement. My grandfather, you know, was chasing me, and the excitement that everybody was so upset about a sailor that drown.</p><p>Speaker 1: Now, your immediate family came over, did you leave any of your other relatives behind, er?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, yes, we left our grandfather behind and uh, that’s was,  that was the only one we left behind. He was alone too. And then I remember one thing, one of our cousins took us all in, “Robisnon” was our cousin and Mrs. Robsinosn and my mother were sisters. So, the funniest thing what happened there, [29:00] I’ll never forget that. When I came in they had brass uh bedroom uh beds, beds, and I went and unscrewed all the brass things, and [inaudible] found out [laughing], and I got a beatin’ [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: So, this is right after you came over? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, I came over, and that's what I remember too. Ya know, I saw brass things, and they all were balls, and I turned all the balls off. I didn’t know that would happen, and it didn't happen until they went in the bed, and I got a beating of our life [laughing].</p><p>Speaker 1: Who administered the beatings in the family? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: My father did. Father was very tough.</p><p>Speaker 1: tell me a little bit about your mother and your father.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well my mother was not a well person, but she had 13 children so she died at the age of 56, pretty young. My father lived to 86, and all I remember my mother is she had a job taking care of the family, but soon as the chil— the girls got a little older, they all helped. Everybody helped, and also when we all got [30:00] together here, the boys—the men worked, everybody worked and everybody helped ‘cause you know, provide money for the house. Then, my father started, you know, teaching violin. </p><p>Speaker 1: ‘kay, what was your mother’s maiden name?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I don’t remember, her name was “Leah”, but I don’t know what uh—oh yeah, “Leah Achbur”, “Leah Achbar”. That was her maiden name. </p><p>Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories she would tell about how she and your father first met, or anything like that?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: There was too much confusion in the house and uh, and uh it was really funny in that uh, like when we ate the oldest one got first, and then I came, and I got last, the reason I got last, I was always unhappy, why was I last? Because the thirteenth was a baby sitting on the mother’s lap, and she would feed her. So, I would always complain, “why do I get last when number thirteen gets first?” So, they would tell me well last year when you were—or the time you were the last one, you were the baby, you were in the mother’s lap, [31:00] you ate first. But I couldn't figure it out. I always was worried: would anything be left by the time it comes to me? [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: But you never starved?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, no. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, but you, so you really didn’t have a lot of time to talk to your mother about things with your father? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, no</p><p>Speaker 1: Is that because there were so many kids around? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: That's right, so much, so much kids, we all had some duties to do, you know what I mean? And, all were religious, we used to go to Temple three times a day, and I had to go to “heder”, ya know, the Hebrew school. Even though— same time I went to school so it was a tough job. School in the daytime and heder at night. </p><p>Speaker 1: I have to turn this tape over here—</p><p>Speaker 3: but mainly, teacher’s administration really had input, the board had input, we had a time to say things that we wanted looked at, programs we wanted to address, to reevaluate, that kind of thing. So, I feel like uhm, Peter and the staff really took time to get input from everybody involved with the budgetary process. </p><p>JHS 08</p><p>[00:00]</p><p>Speaker 1: are uh things that are the results or the by—products or the outgrowth of expanding uh population centers uh, the need for better services. </p><p>Speaker 1: Test 1,2,3. With all the, I guess with all the kids in the family uh you said uh everyone had his or her part. Do you remember some of the things you were assigned to do early on?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I was— didn't seem to be assigned ‘cause I was a little one, ya know? I mixed with small ones so I wasn't assigned to anything except to behave myself [laughing].</p><p>Speaker 1: Stay out of trouble.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah. There was uh my older sisters and brothers they worked and they [inaudible] all the big sisters helped cooking and helped washing and all that stuff so uh, but it was, you know, a lot of confusion in a big home. </p><p>Speaker 1: Who were you closest to among your brothers and sisters?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Of anyone, I was close with my brother and my sister. My younger sister, my older brother. [1:00]</p><p>Speaker 1: Which ones were they again?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Eddie was my older brother and uh, and uh, and Tilly was my younger sister. </p><p>Speaker 1: Why, why do you think you were so attached to them?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, because they were the closest to us, you know what I mean? That’s the ones we played together. The others were far above us, you know what I mean? [laughing] And uh, so uh, and uh then I also went when I first went to school, I went to special grade school to learn English. You know, before you could get in the regular school. And that was kinda, kinda rough.</p><p>Speaker 1: You, you spoke nothing but Hebrew up until then?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Jewish, not Hebrew. Jewish. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, there's a difference. </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, Hebrew’s uh, is what they speak in Israel, and Jewish is a common language, ya know what I mean? But uh, and it was quite tough to—they had special schools for the immigrants to learn how to get together with everybody else.</p><p>Speaker 1: What was the, what was the hardest part about it? Just learning the new language</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, It was kind of funny because uh, [2:00] I could speak a word of English and uh, but I finally— they, they knew what to do, they’re specialists, ya know in immigrants, and I finally was able to get down to regular school, after about six months. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay. Where was this, that you first settled?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: We first settled in uh, in uh, Lamberton street. </p><p>Speaker 1: Was it in?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: In Trenton, yeah. </p><p>Speaker 1: Oh you came straight to Trenton? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, and then from Lamberton Street we went to Centre street, and Centre Street and Centre Street plays right across  a school, it’s called “skelton school”, and that's where I went to school ‘til the eighth grade, see, in eighth grade you go to a special school, but ninth grade you went to [inaudible], and after the ninth grade I went to New York to Yeshiva. My father wanted me to be a Rabbi.</p><p>Speaker 1: How did you feel about that?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, uh, the excitement was that I went—that I had gone to New York, for me to go to New York was an excitement, you know what I mean? But uh, it was the toughest thing I ever had [3:00] in my life, being in Yeshiva. I used to have to go to school, study Talmud and Hebrew, from a quarter to nine ‘till a quarter to four, 15 minutes recess, and from four to eight, I had uh, high school teachers come over. And Sunday was a regular workday. And Sabbath you went to Temple. You were at the Shiva all day, and the first year, over and above the call of duty, a group of us, about four or five of us, would study Talmud all night, and by studying Talmud all night, I skipped, one of the very few to skip from the first of 30 graded Talmud. Talmud is the ancient script of the Bible.</p><p>Speaker 1: Did you retain a lot of what you learned back then?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, I retained a lot because uh it was,  here’s what happened, the idea is, that after I finished high school there, and gone to college, I mean, and went to [inaudible] University, it was so easy, that, I had been for four years and three years and I was on the honor student list. Nothing to it, to go to school for four hours [4:00]. Yeah, I went to school from eight and nine in the morning to, to late at night.</p><p>Speaker 1: Almost like going back to nursery school. [laughing]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I thought I was, I thought I was, really thought I was in jail, and then, and also there was only one month vacation. Eleven months of school, just one month vacation, and you know, to study, to be a Rabbi, is really rough. After, After I got through that I had to have five more years of, of uh, Hebrew, Talmud studies. And boy I said nothing to it I don't wanna be a Rabbi because it’s too, too difficult, this is an Orthodox Rabbi, which is too difficult. </p><p>Speaker 1: So that was what determined for you, your future course, at least the fact that you were not gonna be a Rabbi?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: My father was very unhappy [laughing].</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, your father, you said, was a musician, tell me a little bit more about him.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, he used to give lessons, and uh, he repaired violins, and he'd also play on weddings, play for weddings, and uh, and that's how I knew he worked very hard [5:00]. Worked day and night [inaudible] giving lessons and repairing, repairing uh, the violins, and going to weddings. He worked very hard, he had [inaudible]  you know, a lot of children around.</p><p>Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. So he was, he was paid for performing basically.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Sure, and lessons, and all that stuff, and that’s where I met my wife ‘cause Ida took lessons from my father. And then, and she, and she, she always took the last lesson. My father used to say, “you have to take a little girl like this, she can't go home alone, you must take her”. I said, “Well, I’m a little boy too”, so [laughing], and I used to have to take her, at that time, you know, at my age, I don't know how old I was, I probably was pretty young. Uh, boys didn't think about going around with girls, at eleven years old. </p><p>Speaker 1: It was that young?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah</p><p>Speaker 1: So, that was when you first met her?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah</p><p>Speaker 1: Pretty young age.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, we’ll get back to that part of the story. [laughing] Uh, what uh, made your family decide [6:00] to settle in Trenton?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Only because uh, my wife’s mother, Robinson’s, had a department store, and [inaudible] brought our sister to the family, you know what I mean? Until we were able to get settled.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, so there was [inaudible] the person you brought over with you. What did you say her name was, Robbinson?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, the Robbisnon brought us over</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, Okay, and they lived in Trenton?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: They lived in Trenton, and they were well off, and because they had the department store, and they helped, ya know, pay for the money and everything to bring us over, and then finally we settled by ourselves.</p><p>Speaker 1: How did they happen to know about you, living over there?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, listen it's her sister living in Europe, they used to communicate, send ya know, letters and all that stuff.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: There’s a lot of communication that way.</p><p>Speaker 1: They helped set it up.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh sure, they helped because uh, and she wrote to her sister saying, “gee we’d like to come over because my other children are here, we don’t like half the children in Lithuania and half in America, it’s kind of messing up” [7:00], and they helped get everything together for us.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, so here you were in Trenton uh eleven years old escorting—</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Six years old.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, I’m skipping over a few years there.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Six years old when I got here. </p><p>Speaker 1: Right, okay. Jumping ahead a little bit to around the time where you were escorting young uh, Ida home from her violin lessons. You uh, I imagine saw her just fairly infrequently at first.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, yes, [inaudible] we were in the same grade together, in school, in skelton school, see. And then uh, then they skipped two people from the sixth to the eighth grade, and I was the one person, the one boy, another girl was another girl who was skipped from sixth to the eighth grade that's how I was a very good, I was a very good student. It was nothing after uh, ya know, after studying Hebrew and everything that I knew. It was nothing to it.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, so then uh, [8:00] you went to school in New York for a while.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yes.</p><p>Speaker 1: So, how did you stay in touch with your future wife?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh some—well look I used to come home on the Holidays, you know what I mean? And I used to send her cards, and never she knew who the cards were from ‘cause I used to put different initials on them. I put her initials on em, and finally she figured out who it was.</p><p>Speaker 1: What was it about her that appealed to you?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, the idea’s that her mother uh, was also from Lithuania. So, her mother thought a lot of me, and always like for me to come in the house. Invite me for meals and all that stuff, and to me that was a big deal, you know what I mean? So, because I’m Lithuanian, if you weren’t Lithuanian, her mother would've never want to even look at me, know what I mean?  [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1:  ‘kay, so you sort of had favored status from the very beginning</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, yeah, very beginning.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, now there was that part of it. Then, you just, I guess after a while decided “hey, she’s a pretty nice girl”?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: That’s right, but you see, in other words, then [9:00] when my mother died, see, this is what really happened. Then it was, it was uh—the house was really messed up, ya know? Nobody knew what the hecks to do, and that's when Ida’s mother used to invite me to have dinner because in our house, everything was in turmoil, my mother died, you know what I mean? So uh, that kinda helped everything, too.</p><p>Speaker: So you—there was a little bit more stability over there?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, over there, naturally. They were happy to see me, and also, they thought a lot of my mother. She’s uh—they were in the fish business, see, and my mother used to come there to buy fish, and I always used to go with her. She always asked me to go with her. So, it was a combination: they knew me already, and then when, when she died, then they asked me lot, to come a lot of times because they knew that things were pretty rough in, in my house without a mother.</p><p>Speaker 1: Well, there were, let’s see, Kitty was over there too, right? At the time?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah well, Kitty was, is, was, is, Ida’s sister.</p><p>Speaker 1: Right. [10:00] So, I guess, you favored Ida over Kitty, simply by—</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, Kitty was much younger, see.</p><p>Speaker 1: Oh, she was much younger, okay.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, Ida was my age, she’s a half—year younger then I am.</p><p>Speaker 1: Ah, okay, I was just wondering. [laughing]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin:  And Kitty was much younger.</p><p>Speaker 1: Alright uh, you got to the point uh, you were out of Yeshiva, and then where did you go?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: To Wharton School.</p><p>Speaker 1: Pennsylvania?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania University,  yeah. Wharton school’s accounting.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, had you decided, at this point, that you wanted to get married?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, I had no decision about that except when I finished high school, I mean, college rather, eh you know, my house was a turmoil. See what I mean? It was a turmoil, and then I got very close to her [inaudible] ‘cause I used to commute to college, believe it or not. I used to commute to college and stay home.</p><p>Speaker 1: By train?</p><p>[10:58]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, by train. At the time I used to get a special [11:00] tic-uh, I couldn't afford to live there so, I used to go back and forth, and we got tickets for the whole month, it was cheaper and uh my father wanted me to be home and that's when I saw my wife a hecks of a lot more and also because of the confusion  in my home, I wanted to get married, you know? Get out of the confusion. When my mother died I don’t know something—there seem to be a lot of turmoil in the house, and uh, when I wanted to get married, my father said, “you can't get married, if you have two sisters older than you are, that’s considered an embarrassment”. So, when that happened, we ran away, and got married. [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1:Where'd you run to?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: First we went to Philadelphia. It's really funny, and then uh,and when was it? It was my birthday, and he said uh, “how old are ya?” I said, “I’m 21”. Uh, “when were you 21?” I says, “today”. He says, “get out. You have to come with your parents”. ‘Cause ye—over 21, okay [12:00]. I couldn’t understand it. So we went to Delaware, another place we were, they asked our questions, and I got married there.</p><p>Speaker 1: In Delaware?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: In Delaware. [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: So, how long did you stay in Philadelphia?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, I just went to Philadelphia and came right back, ya know, I was going to Philadelphia regularly to go to school, it was nothin’ to me then, and then uh, then I went to get married and uh when I came home and told my father I got married, well that was it. You know? [laughing] He couldn't say anything, but really the funniest thing is after I got married, my two sisters got married right after that. So, everybody was happy. [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: Right. Okay, so there you were, you were married uh, you were still in school, right?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, I didn’t get married until I graduated school. I waited ‘till I graduated. And right away I got a job. She had a job, working for uh a fine uh candy company, a big company, and uh she did, she did very well. So, and I was working as a uh, as an you know [13:00]? In, with an accounting office, and I got damn little, about twenty—five dollars a week, but she was earning sixty—five dollars a week. That was a hell of alot of money at that time. And you had to work for another accounting office, before you could get your CPA exams, for three years, and uh, so it was really rough, until Igrad—until I was able to get up for myself.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, about what year was that?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, I would say I graduated in 1927 and I apprenticed ‘til 1930.</p><p>Speaker 1: What were things like around uh, Trenton, Philadelphia at that time? It was-</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, it was right in the heart of the depression, it was terrible. Everybody was really uh, ya know? I used to uh, when I worked for Leopold, I was the head of the CPA. I used to work every night for people, doing bookkeeping, and uh, so, I worked day and night practically, so, to get along. And then I, the first time I [14:00] bought, I was, I paid a hundred dollars down and [inaudible] in the depression. And I’ll never forget that my second mortgage was about twenty—five hundred dollars. The man that built the house he got the second mortgage, and things were bad he came over to me, he said, “Look, you wanna make money?” I says, “sure, what do you want? “If you give me a thousand dollars, I’ll, I’ll uh, I’ll call your second mortgage ‘quits, free’”. So, I went to the bank and I told him, “I’m an accountant and I can make a thousand dollars—I can make uh, ya know? fifteen hundred dollars”. It was twenty—five hundred dollars. If. if I had a thousand dollars. “How can you make fifteen hundred dollars?” Back then fifteen hundred dollars is like alot of money. So I told him how I’m working hard, my wife makes sixty—five dollars a week. That, if they could loan me a thousand dollars, I could make [inaudible] can quickly, ya know? I’ll uh, get rid of a [15:00] twenty—five hundred dollar mortgage. Believe it or not they loaned me a thousand dollars. And I had pay them like so much a month. </p><p>[Both Laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: So that, was that your first ho—?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: That was, that was the first house, yeah. </p><p>Speaker 1: That was here in Trenton?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: That was here on Prest Avenue, Ewing Township</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, you said it was around the time of the depression. Now, what sort of effect was that having on people handling [inaudible].</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, the depression was pretty bad then. People were out in the street begging, and, and uh, people were comittin’ suicide, and uh, ya know? Going broke. It just uh, it was understandable to me, I don't know, because it, this was kinda new, but really uh, you worked like hell to make a living. I used to work day and night to make a living.  </p><p>Speaker 1: You were uh, you really saw all this stuff, all around. It was a lot worse than today.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Ya—ohh, I never, never saw anything like it, but uh, but by that time, not knowing anything, to me, I thought that’s the way things were supposed to be, you know what I mean? I didn't know how things were, and uh [16:00] then when I went in for myself, I worked, worked hard, and I, I somehow did uh, pretty good.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, you got married. How soon after that uh, did the kids start?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh we had uh, we had our first child, the first year. Twelve months after we were married, we had the first child. Thereafter, we had a child every 2 ½ years. I have three children. 2 ½ years, 2 ½ years on the dot, button I had a child. [laughing] </p><p> Speaker 1: ‘kay, Lloyd, and Reina, and then Clyde.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, Lloyd, then Reina, then Clyde is right.</p><p>Speaker 1: What was that like for you? Having uh, I mean, you were, you were really the head of the household, the wager, you had to really kinda put your nose to the grindstone. Did you have a lot of time to spend with your kids? [inaudible]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, that’s the, that’s the terrible thing about that I’ll uh, I’ll never forget that. I worked day and night, and I didn’t have the time to spend with the children. See, my wife usually raised most of the children herself, and uh, it was pretty rough. </p><p>Speaker 1: Looking back, how do you feel about missing some of those—?</p><p>[16:59]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, ya see, I didn’t know [17:00] any better. See, now I know better, but that time, those, those were the facts of life in a depression. You really had to work hard to, to eat, to make a  living.</p><p>Speaker 1: I guess, what, what sort of a relationship did you have with your kids as, as you were growing up, or they were growing up?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: uh I didn't have much of a relationship because they were goin’ to school and I was working, and uh my wife took care of most of them. That's all I knew, see, and uh, and I didn't really get together with ‘em till they finished public school and high school, then we, everything was a lot better. </p><p>Speaker 1: Yeah.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: In fact, in fact, the funniest thing about it is I had them work in my office every uh, summer time, their vacation and they used to check the statements, and I used to give ‘em ten cents for, for uh, an error, see, a mistake er—, and give them twenty—five cents for an accounting error, or a business error. So they used to work like [18:00], look like hell, work like hell, to get the twenty—five cents. So, then when they went to coll—want to go to college they first, they check ‘em. They checked highest in accounting [inaudile]. One want to be a doctor [inaudible]. He said, “what the hell do you want to be a doctor or a lawyer? You checked 100% in accounting!” That’s because all this time they worked in my office. If they didn’t do that, they’d never be in my office. Then, of course, when they, when they finished their accounting, they went to my office. </p><p>Speaker 1: [inaudible]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: [inaudible], and I gave ‘em a partnership, immediately, for nothing.</p><p>Speaker 1: ‘mkay, meanwhile, you had Reina, tinkering away on the piano.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, Reina the, was a terrific pianist, and uh, she had a natural talent. She, she use—took lessons from uh, cousin of Sue, one of the finest pianist, and when he heard her play uh, the, the pianist who was givin’ her lessons said, “she’s way above what I can do for her”, and he recommended [inaudible] and [inaudible] had her play for him, and she, she didn't know what heck to do, and she played for him [19:00], and then finally she—every concert that she made, she won prizes, and she was terrific. And she went to Harv—she went to Harvard, and at night she also went to Union conservatory of music, to study music at the same time while she went to school. So, it took her five years because she really worked day and night, and when she graduated uh, New York Conservatory of Music, the finest one gives the concert. She gave the concert for the graduation. She had talent from the very beginning. </p><p>Speaker 1: Were you aware of this as she was growing up?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, sure. I’m in music. I played the violin. My, my wife played the violin and the piano, and, and when she saw, we didn’t ask her to play, but she had some natural talent in piano, she’s a terrific pianist, still.</p><p>Speaker 1: I, I agree, I’ve been there. [laughing] I’ve heard a lot of this [inaudible]. What, was there uh, ever a time where, say the two or the three of you would get together and play?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yes, we’d had, we’d had like uh, a concert on a Sunday, you know [20:00]? I, my wife would play the piano, and [inaudible] played the violin, we all played the violin, and uh, in fact, when the family was there, living, oh everybody played some music. Sometimes the whole family got together and they played the violin, the music, the saxophone, all that stuff. Music was in their heart.</p><p>Speaker 1: So, it was kind of uh, I guess you were thinking a chip off the old block, watching Reina?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, but the funniest thing is, my father was right, when I went to, to Yeshiva, he took my violin away. He said, “I love the violin, I used to practice at night, you know? Every chance I get” he said, “I’m having such a hard time to make a living with a violin, only one in a thousand become really good.” So, he said, “I don’t  want you to be a violinist for a future.” And then, my oldest brother had a store, and he wanted me to do office work for him. So, that’s why I went to Penn for accounting, so I could do so some office work for him in his store. [laughing]</p><p>Speaker 1: Looking back, are you glad you put down the violin? [21:00] [laughing]</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, I was very unhappy about that. In fact, I did steal the violin, and had a da—and on graduation of high school, I played the concert, the violin concert, in the, in the Yeshiva for the high school graduation. So, I still knew ‘bout violin, but after that went to college, I couldn't. I worked and went to college, I was—always had a hard time doing everything. When I went to, when I went to Penn, I worked in the side. I worked day and night.</p><p>Speaker 1: What were the train trips like? Was that, was that a respite for ya?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh that was, yeah, to me it was great. [laughing] You know? You take uh—it went right to the school practically at that time, and you walked to college, you know? Came back and it was a [inaudible] in the depression days, you worked like dogs. That’s all, you work day—I always worked day and night. Even when I started accounting and had a, an office, I was the only one in the office, tax time, who worked January the first ‘till April the fifteenth. Seven days, seven nights a week. Nobody, everybody worked a couple nights or Sundays. I used to work [22:00] seven days, seven nights a week, and uh, in my off—in my office. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, gradually, I imagine all this hard work, work began to pay off?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh yes, I finally took [inaudible]  with me, and the boys came in that had actually a lot. They came in and helped, helped an awful lot.</p><p>Speaker 1: About the time they came in. How big was the office?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, the biggest one—when they came in, I had about four, four or five people in my office. Now, I have thirty—five.</p><p>Speaker 1: Were they, are you talking about four or five accountants other—?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, they were, they were junior accounts, you know what I mean? And they had to, had to get experience in a accounting office before they could take their CPA exam. Things are different now. Now, you go to college, and you take your exams before you take your apprenticing. That time, you had to, you had to have three years of apprenticing. So, I always had some people who wanted to apprentice in my office, and I didn’t give him very much [23:00], and when they became accounts, I gave ‘em, I gave ‘em a good deal. Some of ‘em I made partners and all that stuff to keep ‘em steady.</p><p>Speaker 1: How did you feel, bringing in Lloyd and Clyde? Here are your sons, uh you know, you hadn't really had a chance to spend a lot of time with ‘em growing up, but here they were.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Uh, that’s when I spent a lot of time. [laughter] But really it was the greatest thing that could happen to me because many children don't want to go with their parents, but because the college who, who took there, ya know? Who checked them, they says, “your crazy if you don't go to yer—an accounting office. [inaudible] It was the highest exam- marks that they got, and it was accounting. They checked ‘em for law, medicine, ya know? Doctors, Lawyers and everything, nothing like accounting because [laughing] they, they were looking for the quarters. [laughter]</p><p>Speaker 1: So, at that point uh, things really got rolling in?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, yeah.</p><p>Speaker 1: How did they like it?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: They always seemed to like it. They seemed to like it because [24:00] as, as things grew, I gradually tried to get away from them, have them run the business, you know what I mean? And uh, they liked it, they seemed to enjoy it. In fact, like Lloyd wanted to be a lawyer, really, so he did, he still does the tax research which is uh, a lawyer must research everything. Nobody likes to research, he likes to research. </p><p>Speaker 1: Well now, ‘kay, here you had this, this accounting office going in Trenton and uh, now the idea being, I guess, to accumulate a lot of clients. How did you go about getting your business?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, actually, really, when you do a good job, and I did it somehow, I was a darn good accountant, and showed people how to make money, and it was a natural instinct for me. They would recommend me. See, they heard about me and they’d recommend me. I had a man who was gonna go bankrupt, and he called me in, and he said, “what could you do?”, and I looked at uh, looked at his books and I said, “I think I could help ya” [25:00]. Uh, nobody wanted to give him any, any credit because he was in bad shape, owed so much money. I said, “let’s take merchandise from people that doesnt, that doesn't know you”, and then after that, I went with him to the, the greatest, to the most profitable laundry in, in New Jersey. Big laundry in New Yo—North Jersey, and they told us how to conduct business. They said, “first of all, I’ll bet that your men look dirty, and your cars look dirty”. They says, “they should all be dressed up, and the cars should shine”. So, cars should mean something and then at the same time, this laundry had twelve people. “One, I’ll bet” he said, “One person's good and the other’s not,  isn’t so hot. I said, “that’s right. How do you know?” He says, “Man’s take- take the good man and put him on the worst [inaudible] and gradually work up the good business” see. And I worked with him all the way through, and finally, when that happened, he finally became very wealthy [26:00], and he gave me a piece of his business. [laughing] And so, I was told [inaudible] in the accounting business you shouldn’t be a partner with a client. So, after a while, I sold him my half back, but, and I went in business with a—I went deals with a lot of clients who pro—who were, who knew what they were doing. If they made money, they were the right place to do business with, and to work with ‘em, you know what I mean? Like, a real estate man, uh everything he did was perfect, and uh so I went into a few deals with him, and every day he did, I made—went for them, I made money. </p><p>Speaker 1: What was the, if you had to look back uh, on your, just on your professional life, what, what was the biggest disappointment do you think you ever suffered?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I don't remember any disappointments. Truly True. I was so involved in my own business se, that to me uh, ya know? And I was involved by having, having to take care of my family too. They all went to colleges, ya know? And I had to [27:00] send ‘em to college, and they didn't have to work their way through college like I did, and uh, so, I used to put away money for college, for them, and uh, each had their own reserve, and somehow they never used it. I paid for the college, and when they got out, or when they got married, I gave them those reserves [inaudible] for ‘em.</p><p>Speaker 1: So, really, you had uh, a pretty darn good career.</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: I could, but I worked hard, all my life.</p><p>Speaker 1: Well, what would you, what would you say was the high point of your, just of your working life?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Well, the high point was that I, that I did very well, and my reputation was so good, that I did well, that I could do things for people, [inaudible] I had a, a, a restaurant, who was doing a lot of business and didn't make any money. So, they called me in, and they asked me, “so, I heard about you, let me see what you can do for us” [28:00]. So, I said to them, “let me see your program—I mean yer, yer, not your program, your, menu”. I said, they were doing about, almost a million dollars worth of business, and, and not making any money. I said, “If you raise 10% of every item in there, nobody would know the difference, but it would mean a hell of a lot to you”. I mean, if something sells for, let's say $3.50, suppose you make it $3.60. And uh, in the liquor business—drinks, raise a nickel. Doing that alone, made these people so wealthy that they didn't know what to do with me. See, so I, so I did for other people, I showed people how to make money in their business, and that’s really an art, but that was my art, and that attracted me a lot of clients. </p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, how ‘bout uh, just in your, your family life what’s, what do ya, would you look back on and say a high point for you?</p><p>[29:00] Joseph Klatzkin: Well, the high point in my life was that I was so happy that my daughter was doing so well, my sons were able to do so well like Clyde is an expert on the states, Llyod’s an expert on tax research and uh, the, even the [inaudible] thought a an awful lot of our organization, and so uh, I was very happy to work with all of ‘em.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay, here’s a tough one for ya, [laughing] what, what did you think, when you grew up a firm Jewish tradition, when your daughter uh, married outside the faith?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Very, very unhappy. In fact, the first time when he came over to the house I threw him out. [laughing] </p><p>Speaker 1: For that reason alone?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, and that was a mistake. ‘Cause when you do that, that’s when you really, that’s when they really uh, do get married anyway, and when they get married [inaudible] we tried to uh, get together. That was a bad mistake, and I found out that it was a mistake ‘cause when I saw my other [30:00] bro—other brothers, when they came in uh, with people I didn’t like, I would never say that I didn’t like, I would take ‘em all out to dinner, take ‘em to New York, and finally, they themselves found out they were wrong in who they were dealing with, but if you tell a child what not to do, that's what they’ll do.</p><p>Speaker 1: So your first experience with that was with your daughter? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Yeah, my daughter. That was the first experience, and that happened. Then, it helped me with the other two children.</p><p>Speaker 1: Later on, were you able to accept her relationship?</p><p>Joseph Klatksin: Oh yeah, we got very friendly, we accept the relationship, and uh, and I was happy.</p><p>Speaker 1: Okay. Now, ultimately, you became my grandfather. [laughing] What was that like for ya?</p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: Oh, that was great, to me, having grandchildren meant, meant an awful lot. Uh, as you know, all my grandchildren, uh, when they finished high school, they could go anywhere in the world as a gift, as an incentive to go to college. You did too, and uh, and we took them, and that to me was the greatest thing in the world. [31:00]</p><p>Speaker 1: Uh, I suppose now, if you could look back, ya know? You’ve had a long career, and uh, ya know? Everything sounds like it's been working out for ya, since—just anything in particular that uh, that stands out that you've, ya know, if you were to say, “well, gee, I’m really glad this happened . . . “, have we covered it already? </p><p>Joseph Klatzkin: No, I, I’m I’m happy with what I did. In fact, right now, I took a 95% cut in my pay, and I work half—days because I wanna be uh—and I dont wanna be fully retard. I found when, when my clients worked hard and retired suddenly, became vegetables. So, I still take care of uh, uh, estates.</p>        <!-- button that links to the comment page-->        <div class="right3">       <li class="right3"><a class="cbutton" href="{{ url_for('comment') }}">Make a Comment</a></li>        </div>    </main></body></html>
