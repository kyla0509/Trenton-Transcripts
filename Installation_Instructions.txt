Download the contents of our repo. Within the file CAB Docs are the needed files. Please see our Stage 5a wiki page for more information about each file.

With psql installed, run these commands to change your user permissions to super user:
	sudo -u postgres psql
	alter role <your username> superuser
This allows you to use COPY in the CopyCSV.sql file.
In the CopyCSV file, you may need to change the path specified for the FROM command. Also, in the run.sh file, you may need to change the path to each .sql file.
Once your permissions and paths are set, create your database by typing the following commands:
	chmod +x run.sh
	./run.sh
This is a script that completes the tasks of creating tables, as well as populating them with data. The script leaves you within the psql database and from there, you are able to begin using psql queries to do whatever you may need to do with the data!

To drop the database. Run the command:
	\i drop.sql
in your psql database to drop all the views and tables. Enter:
	\q 
to exit your database and enter:
	dropdb TrentonianaDB
to drop the entire database.
