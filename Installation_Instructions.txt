With psql installed, run these commands to change your user permissions to super user:
	sudo -u postgres psql
	alter role <your username> superuser
This allows you to use COPY in the CopyCSV.sql file.
In the CopyCSV file, you may need to change the path specified for the FROM command. Also, in the run.sh file, you may need to change the path to each .sql file.
Once your permissions and paths are set, create your database by typing the following commands (make sure you have cd into your Documents folder):
	chmod +x run.sh
	./run.sh
