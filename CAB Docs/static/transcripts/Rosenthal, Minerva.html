She was a uh Rosenthal and uh we’re going to try to break down and have her memory go back as far as she wants to go uh with originally your parents, where did they come from? What did they do before they came to the United States? </p><p>[0:30]</p><p>Minerva: My father and mother came from Vilna. My father, I understand, sold flour and my mother worked in the bakery and that’s where the love started. He came here first, to Ellis Island, he came to Trenton cause there was family here, cousin by name of Max Rosenthal. </p><p>Interviewer: What, what was Max Rosenthal? </p><p>Minerva: A cousin.</p><p>Interviewer: I know, but what did he do for a living in Trenton?</p><p>[1:00]</p><p>Minerva: I don’t remember.</p><p>Interviewer: Okay, alright, and then</p><p>Minerva: And then my mother went to New Haven and that’s where she, my father, they were sweethearts in the old country.</p><p>Interviewer: Okay what what was</p><p>Minerva: They knew each other, my mother </p><p>Interviewer: What was her maiden name? </p><p>Minerva: My mother’s name was Saya, Sarah, Saya</p><p>Interviewer: And that’s her, what’s her last name?</p><p>Minerva: Siet</p><p>Interviewer: S i e t, okay. </p><p>Minerva: Yeah, and uh, the Shores were in New Haven, the Shore family, I think they’re still there </p><p>[1:30]</p><p>Minerva: and of course they got together cause they knew each other and they were married in Trenton, New Jersey on South Warren Street. They used to call it under the bridge, that’s before our time. And my parents, I think, moved to Decatur street where all the Jewish families were and from Decatur street they went to Moren street. </p><p>[2:03]</p><p>Interviewer: Okay now when they lived on Decatur street, uh, were there any children at that time?</p><p>Minerva: See I don’t remember. </p><p>Interviewer: Okay uh</p><p>Minerva: Colonel would be, no, see I don’t remember what year they were married but Colonel has to be, Mabel was ‘88, you’re not taking this in</p><p>Interviewer: No </p><p>Minerva: Mable was ‘88 and after Mabel came Monty and I would imagine </p><p>[2:30]</p><p>Minerva: Colonel would be like maybe ‘94, ‘95, Maxine would know that. See Sy would know all that, I can’t remember by name. And, by that, my father I think was a junk peddler with a horse and buggy. He used to go to Bristle cause as children we used to go to Bristle to visit this family. I remember that distinctly. </p><p>Interviewer: What was that family name?</p><p>Minerva: I don’t know, it’s so long ago. And um</p><p>[3:00]</p><p>Minerva:  he had a horse and buggy and then he met a man, by the time I was born, we lived on Warren Street and we had a very nice big old house where we slid down the banister and the summer kitchen and the winter kitchen and the very big house. That’s in that’s where I was born. And Sy and Rita. And I don’t remember whether Sharky was born on Decatur Street or Warren Street.</p><p>[3:30]</p><p>Interviewer: How many children were there? </p><p>Minerva: We are seven we were seven children and we are now two. </p><p>Interviewer: How many boys and how many girls?</p><p>Minerva: Four boys and three girls. Four boys and three girls. And my father met a man, where and how, I do not know, a Mr. Shanteer who knew how to make reclaim rubber and they went to the bank and they got a hundred thousand dollars collateral without any security, the two men and they built the original {inaudible} Rubber Company was on Olden and Clinton where the Lenox factory later was and that burned down and that’s when they we still lived on Warren Street I remember that the factory burning and my father and all the books and all that in the house and then they bought the land he bought I don’t ever knew Mr. Shanteer he was out of the picture by the time I was born and uh they moved to the East Trenton area where they presently were all these years and they made reclaim rubber </p><p>[4:45]</p><p>Interviewer: Now when they made reclaim rubber, what was the product that they </p><p>Minerva: It was a ground op, they took old tires and old tubes and they cooked them and they baked them and they did all kinds of things. See Sy would know all of that, he worked with it. And that’s way before his time. And I remember uh my uncle um Abe Rosenthal my Aunt Chippy, remember Chippy Ross, his father worked for my father and this little Polish man Samke we used to call him sat on boxes and they I got the scissors one scissor and they used to take out remember what tires had that thing in the middle?</p><p>Interviewer: Yup</p><p>Minerva: They used to cut that out and then they mixed it like a cooking process. </p><p>[5:33]</p><p>Interviewer: And then it came out as </p><p>Minerva: As it came out as a flat thing like this in sort of a greyish black they used to call it um actually it was sheets and that to the present day is how they shipped it</p><p>Interviewer: Okay now what what did they what was that to be used for after they shipped it?</p><p>Minerva: All kinds of things. Tires uh Johnson and Johnson, that’s all after my father</p><p>[6:01]</p><p>Minerva: Johnson and Johnson was a customer, Minnesota Mining was a customer, see Sy will know all that. There was a place in Philadelphia and Colonel knew all these great people he was a magnificent man my brother Colonel. Johnson and Johnson, Bunny man one day said man how the hell did your brother get into Johnson and Johnson they’re so antisemetic, we all have Johnson stock. My father in my lifetime was successful. We moved to Berkeley Avenue into a beautiful house and I guess I was in fourth grade, no Jews on the street and Mr. Hunt the architect went to the bank and did not want them to sell my father the house. And he told them that we were a very fine Jewish family and we really those even living today will tell you we had a beautiful home.</p><p>[7:01]</p><p>Interviewer: You remember what number that was?</p><p>Minerva: 831 Berkeley Avenue. My father always had a car but never drove. We had a Humpmobile when I was a little girl and then by the time we got to Berkeley Avenue we had a Dodge and a Cadillac and he never drove us! And the Cadillac stood in the garage. It was a two car garage covered with canvas so it shouldn’t get dirty. By that time Colonel and Monty were driving and I I went to kindergarten at {inaudible} school. And they would not they didn’t want the Jews and the kids got all dressed up as Ku Klux Klans and started to stone us and our neighbor Mrs. Taylor from {inaudible} and Taylor stopped all that and the Hunt’s we all became very friendly and by the time you know they accepted us as Jews but that goes back a long time because I might have been fourth or fifth grade at that time junior three wasn’t built yet, you know. </p><p>[8:01]</p><p>Interviewer: Okay but where was the junior school? Where did they go after </p><p>Minerva: They I don't remember where the kids went at that time cause Trenton High they did go to Trenton High, Monty and Mabel well I'm a graduate of Trenton High they all went where they went in the area I do not know. They used to take a trolly and then as the boys Monty and Colonel got older they drove to school they drove to Trenton High </p><p>Interviewer: Okay that was on the corner of Hamilton Chestnut then </p><p>[8:30]</p><p>Minerva: Chestnut then I only went there a half a year and then went into the new school. Junior three was not built yet but we went to {inaudible} seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grade I think Sharky Sy and I and my sister Rita because by that time you know and my father was a very kind religious um I don't know how to put the word uh uh very helped a lot of people helped a lot of people helped them got started helped with business. By the time I was born my father was successful see I know </p><p>[9:12]</p><p>Interviewer: Now did he where did the raw material come from? Did</p><p>Minerva: Tires </p><p>Interviewer: No I mean who supplied them with them did the Trenton junk peddlers bring stuff </p><p>Minerva: Oh they were too big for Trenton peddlers they would buy like carloads of stuff they couldn't buy from a Trenton peddler because our factory on East Aides five times the size of this </p><p>[9:37]</p><p>Interviewer: Is that still operating now? </p><p>Minerva: No they went bankrupt. Vyron put them out of business. By that time Sy and Sharky had it </p><p>Interviewer: Okay but did they did they sell it to somebody or they were still the owners right till the end</p><p>Minerva: No it was just closed I can’t tell you that see Sy knows all that we don’t talk about that because it’s a hard egg. But they were successful. My father how he got into all of these places I don’t know Sy would know that. </p><p>[10:05]</p><p>Minerva: Colonel went to NYU, we still lived on Warren street.
